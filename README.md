# Vechical_Cut_In_detection_Using_IDD
This project uses OpenCV and YOLOv3 Tiny for object detection in a video. It categorizes detected objects into predefined zones ("Safe," "Warning," "Danger") based on their positions relative to road lanes, annotating them with bounding boxes and color-coded labels to indicate their safety status.
